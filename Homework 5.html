## Question 1

Assign to the variable n_dims a single random integer between 3 and 10.
```{r}
n_dims<- sample(3:10, 1)

```

Create a vector of consecutive integers from 1 to n_dims2.
```{r}
con_ints<- c(1:(n_dims)^2)

```

Use the sample function to randomly reshuffle these values.

```{r}
random<- sample(con_ints)

```

Create a square matrix with these elements and print matrix
```{r}
matrix1<- matrix(data=random, ncol=n_dims, nrow=n_dims)
print(matrix1)
```

Find a function in r to transpose the matrix.
```{r}
trans<- t(matrix1)
print(trans)
```
The data is flipped along the diagonal. 


Calculate the sum and the mean of the elements in the first row and the last row.
```{r}
sum_1<- sum(trans[1, ])
mean_1<- mean(trans[1,])
print(cat("sum of row 1 =", sum_1, "and mean of row 1 =", mean_1, " "))

sum_last<- sum(trans[nrow(trans), ])
mean_last<- mean(trans[nrow(trans), ])
print(cat("sum of last row=", sum_last, "and mean of last row =", mean_last, " "))

```


read about the eigen() function and use it on your matrix

```{r}
eigan<- eigen(trans, symmetric=FALSE)
#eigan$values
#eigan$vectors

```

Look carefully at the elements of $values and $vectors. What kind of numbers are these?


Eigan values are numbers of any value while eigan vectors are bounded between -1 and 1. It seems that the eigan vectors therefore give directionality and eigan values give the magnitude of the vector.  



Dig in with the typeof() function to figure out their type.

```{r}
typeof(eigan$values)

typeof(eigan$vectors)


```

if have set your code up properly, you should be able to re-run it and create a matrix of different size because n_dims will change.


Correct, although I separated it so you need to run all the code chunks separately. 


## Question 2

Create a list with the following named elements:

1) my_matrix, which is a 4 x 4 matrix filled with random uniform values
2) my_logical which is a 100-element vector of TRUE or FALSE values. Do this efficiently by setting up a vector of random values and then applying an inequality to it.
3) my_letters, which is a 26-element vector of all the lower-case letters in random order.
4) create a new list, which has the element[2,2] from the matrix, the second element of the logical vector, and the second element of the letters vector.
5) use the typeof() function to confirm the underlying data types of each component in this list
6) combine the underlying elements from the new list into a single atomic vector with the c() function.

what is the data type of this vector?
```{r}

my_matrix<- matrix(runif(16,1,10), 4,4)

data<- c(1:100)
data<- sample(data)  ## made random 
my_logical<- data < 50 ## true / false 

my_letters<- sample(letters[1:26])


my_list<- list(my_matrix[2,2], my_logical[2], my_letters[2])
print(my_list)


typeof(my_matrix)
typeof(my_logical) 
typeof(my_letters)

my_vec<- c(my_matrix[2,2], my_logical[2], my_letters[2])
print(my_vec)

```  

##Question 3

Create a data frame with two variables (= columns) and 26 cases (= rows).
call the first variable my_unis and fill it with a random uniform value from 0 to 10

call the second variable my_letters and fill it with 26 capital letters in random order.

```{r}
my_unis<- runif(26,1,10)
my_letters<- sample(LETTERS[1:26])

dataframe<- data.frame(my_unis, my_letters)

```

for the first variable, use a single line of code in R to select 4 random rows and replace the numerical values in those rows with NA.

for the first variable, write a single line of R code to identify which rows have the missing values.

```{r}
my_unis[sample(1:26, 4)]<- NA  ## assigned NA to 4 random elements 

which(!complete.cases(my_unis)) ## identifies the positions of all NAs

```


for the second variable, sort it in alphabetical order

calculate the column mean for the first variable.

```{r}
sort(my_letters)
mean(my_unis, na.rm=TRUE)  # removed the NAs and calculated the mean


```
